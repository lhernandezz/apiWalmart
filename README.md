This is rest api example that call walmart api -phase1 zip code store locator
How to set up....
If you want to start from generic side menu
$ ionic start whatevername sidemenu --v2
dowload directory to use working sample.
Note: you may want to goto walmart developers and create you free api account to get your own key as mine may change.
This example takes zip code to rest api
Leassons learnt...
When importing your web service pay close attention to the paths because you might not always get an error
but you will notic something is wrong because you will get blank screens.
For begining building test, it best to load empty or generic menu and build and test each added piece.
Cross client issues can make rest api call fail..To make this example work i run it in chrome and downloaded extension.
Extension "Enable Cross Client" bypasses cross client issut my settings:
